Yorkshire fog					Cirrus, roll & shelf
Horn-tooth, hair-cap				Incus, waves & waves
Wind-blown, broom				Nacreous: mamma, mamma & mamma
St. Augustine					Pareidolia, layered & smooth like cauliflower
Grass sticks pal-ate				A cleft cloud, split skies
Mushrooms					Blown up, boiling black
Bog pits					Velum, velvet fibres & fibres & fibres
Sump, slough					Mackerel, pink & downdrafts.

I see myself buzzing around daisies -   		Blundering but fervid, humming down
Honey cups & making yellow funnels		Explode with my prodigious ringing
                                                                                  
                                                                              & bubble-like downward protuberances.
