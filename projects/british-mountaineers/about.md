{% include british-mountaineers/nav.html %}

*British Mountaineers* is a series of poetic erasures. Written in 1942, F. S. Smytheâ€™s biographical text of the same title forms the original canvas where words are picked, painted and stitched together to create a new, dream-like narrative. 

Erasure poetry is the process of erasing, covering or otherwise obscuring selected words from an existing text to create a new poem from the ones left untouched. Erasure can be an act of collaboration, or it can be a means of confronting the ideas expressed by another author.

Akin to following a narrow Alpine ridge, each page treads a delicate line between poetry and visual art linked together by the fictional experience of an avalanche victim. Buried under the snow, this lost spirit is guided through the strange and elemental landscape of the page from word to word, trying to make sense of their collapsed surroundings. 

Raising questions regarding our relationship with a history which has glorified the conquering of mountain lands to rewrite and remove the stories of so many, *British Mountaineers* tracks the journey of an anonymous figure found by reading between the lines. It explores the ways in which a mountain might change us; what it might reveal, and what it might erase.
